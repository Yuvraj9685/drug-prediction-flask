💊 Drug Prediction Using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that predicts the most suitable drug for a patient based on medical attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and sodium-to-potassium ratio.

This project demonstrates a complete ML pipeline — from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

📌 Project Overview

Drug prescription is a critical task in healthcare. Incorrect medication can lead to serious health risks.
This project applies machine learning classification techniques to assist in predicting the appropriate drug based on patient data.
